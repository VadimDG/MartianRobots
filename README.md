assumptions:
1. The game input is done with no mistakes. If there are any the game is stoped
2. Robots can share same point in the end of thier movement

estimation of building an entire solution:
it depends on graphical requirements, interface, online or offline mode. If online 
the estimation will include a desired number of users for load estimation.
If it's a single player game with a graphical map and drawing a path on a map than from a week 
depending on a map requirements.
If it's more complicated UI - 2-3 weeks

Multiplayer mode will require more effort in setting up software/hardware for users.
